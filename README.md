# AdventureWorks-Queries
This project contains queries based on 11 business questions given to me based on the [Microsoft AdventureWorks 2019 Database](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/adventureworks/AdventureWorks2019.bak). It as carried on SSMS using SQL Server.
The AdventureWorks Database contains nearly 70+ tables and views, hence this project required a lot of patience and analytical thinking. From understanding the [Data Dictionary](https://dataedo.com/download/AdventureWorks.pdf) to producing optimised queries. Some skills that came useful in this project include:
* Joins (Types and Where to Use Them)
* Common Table Expressions
* Window Functions, etc.
